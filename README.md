This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving mutable and immutable references.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through a mutable reference while an immutable reference to the same value exists. This results in a compile-time error, highlighting Rust's borrow checker preventing data races. The solution, found in `bugSolution.rs`, shows how to restructure the code to avoid this conflict.
